# hFlux

hFlux -- lightweight toolkit for tokamak simulation code diagnostics.

# Key features
* Poloidal flux function.
* Continuous, smooth and divergence free magnetic field reconstructionk.
* Built-in divergence cleaning, input fields do not require to be divergence free.
* Second order differentials of flux function (for example $\nabla B$, $\nabla \times B$).
* Calculation of magnetic axis.
* Safety-factor for arbitrary flux surfaces.
* Field line calculations, supporting Poincare plot data output.
* C/C++ interface, Python and Julia Wrappers.
